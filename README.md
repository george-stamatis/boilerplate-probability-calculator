# Polygon Area Calculator

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum for the "Scientific Computing with Python" certification. The Polygon Area Calculator involves implementing object-oriented programming concepts in Python to create classes for rectangles and squares.

# Project Description

The Polygon Area Calculator utilizes object-oriented programming principles in Python to construct a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class is designed as a subclass of Rectangle, inheriting its methods and attributes. The aim of the project is to create a functional polygon area calculator that facilitates various operations with rectangles and squares.

This project is written in Python.
